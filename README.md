# Twitter CLI

Simple command line interface for Twitter using the [twint]("https://github.com/twintproject/twint") library. This isn't designed to be a client which supports logging in - but allows you to fetch, search & sort tweets for any given user, or a list of users.

The main advantage of twint is being able to query Twitter without any rate limitations. I use this to follow people/topics I find interesting - as the defualt Twitter feed tends to be clogged up with suggested posts - or only show those which are already popular.

(Warning - this code is ðŸ—‘ - I don't write code like this for work ðŸ˜„)
